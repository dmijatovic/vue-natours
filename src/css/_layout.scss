  /** FONT size and relative sizes calculation using rem
  we want to enable user to set the fontsize but we also need
  easy way to calculate out rem units. To achieve both the following
  approach is advised. Default font size is 16px. So setting font size
  to 100% we now that our starting size for 1rem = 16px. It would be easer 
  for us if we can set start to 10px so we can easily use decimals in rem,
  for example 10px = 1rem => 1.65rem = 16.5px. To achive easy math we 
  can set font size to 10/16 = 62.5%. Note! when changin size here 
  the complete layout will change because most of dimensions are set 
  in rem units. 

  I want to try to keep 100% here and use scaled rem steps. For example,
  if we assume 16px as starting point, we scale in steps of 0.25 rem (4px).
  see _variables for defined rem size variables
